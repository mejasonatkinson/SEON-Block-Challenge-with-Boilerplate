# Backend (WP Admin)

In the WordPress Admin, you can generate the new custom Gutenberg block by typing `/SEON Block Challenge with Boilerplate` or by using the plus icon in the top left corner to search for it under the DESIGN category on any page or post.

The block comprises of several input elements, including:

- Media Uploader (for the image)
- Text Input (for the heading)
- Text Input (for the content)
- Text Input (for the CTA link)
- Text Input (for the CTA text)
- Toggle Input (for reversing the layout, displaying the image and text on opposite sides compared to the default position)

You can view what it looks like here:

There was one challenging issue, which unfortunately remains unresolved. For some unknown reason, I am unable to select the entire block, which prevents the display of additional options, including the option to delete. Despite extensive research, which suggested that this functionality should work by default, it doesnâ€™t seem to work for me. You can still delete the block and access options using the Document Overview, located in the icon navigation in the top left of any given page or post, and then clicking on the three dots next to the custom block. This issue does not affect the end user, and there is a workaround for the site editor, but if I had more time, I would investigate this further.
