# Conclusion

This challenge was an engaging and educational experience. Despite facing several hurdles, such as access issues with Figma and installation challenges with the `@wordpress/create-block` package, I was able to create a functional custom Gutenberg block. The process enhanced my understanding of both frontend and backend development within the WordPress ecosystem. Although some minor issues remain, I believe the project meets the required standard. I look forward to applying these learnings to future projects and continuing to refine my skills in WordPress development.
