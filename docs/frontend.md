# Frontend

The frontend of the website is based on the Figma design. It includes an image, heading, content, and call-to-action link elements with typography styling and spacing using a mobile-first approach and breakpoints for tablet and desktop screen sizes.

I have included image screenshots for all three sizes:

- [Mobile](images/mobile.png)
- [Tablet](images/tablet.png)
- [Desktop](images/desktop.png)

Overall, the design is quite minimal, but I believe it is in line with the Figma file.

Regarding the frontend, I encountered two main issues.

The first issue was not having access to the Figma file, which was quickly resolved after I requested access.

The second issue stemmed from the way Figma works. By default and for free, Figma allows access to the file in design mode, which provides many details but does not allow the same capabilities for measuring distances between elements as Dev Mode does. Figma's Dev Mode requires additional access requests, and while the request was being processed, Figma allows temporary access for up to 14 days. However, my request was rejected immediately, blocking further access. I did my best with the available resources to generate the spacing values for the frontend styling. My conclusion is that Dev Mode in Figma is a paid feature, valued per user. I apologies if my access request caused any issues.
