# Introduction

As I mentioned previously, I have never built a custom Gutenberg block before. Because of this, I encountered some unexpected challenges.

To start my preparation for this task, I dedicated several hours to researching how custom Gutenberg blocks are generally created. This led me to the discovery of `@wordpress/create-block`, which is inspired by the Create React App, a tool I am familiar with, as well as similar alternatives for Vue.

I have broken down this documentation into several parts for easy reading:

- [Frontend](frontend.md)
- [Backend (WP Admin)](backend-wp.md)
- [Backend (Code)](backend-code.md)
- [Conclusion](conclusion.md)
